# game-suggest
 
"Game Suggest" is the final project of the React JS course taught by "Escuela DevRock". Originally it was an app that recommended similar musical artists, but I decided to give it a twist using a video game API.

- Search for any videogame title you want.
- Get useful information such as game description, release date, score and genre.
- Get recommended games based on visual similarity.

Built using React JS and RAWG Video Game Database API (https://rawg.io/apidocs).
