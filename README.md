# game-suggest
 
"Game Suggest" is the final project of the React JS course taught by "Escuela DevRock". Originally it was an app that recommended similar musical artists, but I decided to give it a twist using a video game API to recommend video games instead.

The application allows you to search for a game title, and once selected it displays a screen with information such as name, description, score, genre and release date. Below this data it displays the top 4 recommended games, taking as a starting point the one currently displayed. This is accomplished using the API's "/suggest" endpoint.
